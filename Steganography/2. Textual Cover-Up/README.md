# Textual Cover-Up
Concealing textual information in the form of a
rather absurd play's script.

## Execution
1. Copy the play from `story.txt`.
2. Open Sam's Big G PlayMaker.
3. Paste the play's script inside it.
4. Decrypt the hidden message. Use the default
   built-in wordlists and replacements.
